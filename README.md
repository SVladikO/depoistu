# DEPOISTU
Aggregator for country menu.
I wanted to collect all menu of Ukraine in one place and help people to find right cafe in any location in Ukraine.
I worked on this project 18 months.

### Which repository you need to run this project locally ?
* FE this repository
* BE - DEPOISTU-API
* DB SCHEMA - [DEVELOP_DATA.sql](database%2FDEVELOP_DATA.sql)
* Design for figma - FIGMA_UI.fig

#### Quick Start
1. Clone FE, BE
2. `npm i` for both FE/BE
3. `npm run start` for FE (for depoistu/src/utils/config.js/getDomainBE() for localhost:3000 set BE localhost for which we will make a call)
4. `npm run dev` for BE (run DB server before and enter right credentials to depoistu-api/package.json/scrips/dev)

And it all should work.
